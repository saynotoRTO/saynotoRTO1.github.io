  <textarea id="emailBody">
Governor Newsom is presenting himself as a climate champion on the national stage ‚Äî yet here in California, he‚Äôs quietly enforcing a policy that will increase greenhouse gas emissions, punish low-income communities, and roll back progress on equity and sustainability.

His Return-to-Office (RTO) mandate for state workers forces tens of thousands of employees back into daily commutes ‚Äî despite ample data showing telework significantly reduces emissions, traffic congestion, and strain on public infrastructure.

This decision isn‚Äôt about public service. It‚Äôs about power and control ‚Äî and it comes at the direct expense of California‚Äôs climate goals.

Let‚Äôs be clear:

‚Ä¢ Thousands of additional cars on the road every weekday will massively increase air pollution.  
‚Ä¢ California‚Äôs legally mandated goal of reducing vehicle miles traveled is being blatantly undermined.  
‚Ä¢ Working women, especially mothers and caregivers, are being stripped of the flexibility that helped them succeed.  
‚Ä¢ Low-income workers are now forced to pay more for gas, childcare, and long commutes ‚Äî all while losing hours of their day and quality of life.  
‚Ä¢ Communities already suffering the impacts of environmental racism will be disproportionately affected once again.

This is environmental injustice. It is economic injustice. And it is a betrayal of everything California claims to stand for.

The science is clear: telework works. The data is clear: emissions were down. The voices of workers are clear: they want flexibility, health, and fairness.

Governor Newsom‚Äôs RTO mandate is a political maneuver dressed in bureaucracy ‚Äî and it is costing lives, livelihoods, and our climate future.

We urgently need your voice. Please consider:

‚Ä¢ Issuing a public statement against the RTO mandate  
‚Ä¢ Urging Governor Newsom and state leadership to reconsider  
‚Ä¢ Engaging the media and amplifying this climate equity issue now

Environmental justice is not a slogan ‚Äî it‚Äôs a commitment. Please speak out.
